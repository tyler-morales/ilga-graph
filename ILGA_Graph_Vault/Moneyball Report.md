## Methodology

The Moneyball Score is a weighted composite of five normalized metrics:

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Effectiveness | 30% | Laws Passed / Laws Filed (HB/SB) |
| Pipeline Depth | 20% | How far bills progress (0=filed, 6=signed) |
| Magnet Score | 20% | Avg co-sponsors per law (normalized) |
| Bridge Score | 15% | Cross-party co-sponsorship rate |
| Network Centrality | 15% | Co-sponsorship graph degree |

**No-Fluff Filter**: Only substantive legislation (HB/SB) counts for effectiveness and pipeline metrics. Resolutions (HR/SR/HJR/SJR) are tracked separately.

**Leadership Filter**: Members with formal leadership titles (Speaker, Leader, Whip, etc.) are ranked separately so we can surface "hidden gems."
